# Downloading Vagrant

For this page, go to the appropriate files depending on what OS you have in
your computer. Remember once we have Vagrant and Virtualbox, we can virtually
spin up any OS inside Vagrant. For this page we are downloading according to
what OS you have in your computer.

Downloading is very simple go to the Vagrant website [download page](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).

* if you have a Windows OS, download the **.msi** file which will download vagrant and all its needed
components.
* if you have a Linux Debian OS (such as Ubuntu) download the **.deb** file which will install as software.
* if you have a macOS download the **.dmg** file which will install as software.

You will need also to download Vitualbox. Virtualbox is a general-purpose full 
virtualizer for x86 hardware, targeted at server, desktop and embedded use. First
we need to go to the Virtualbox [download page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) .

* For Windows OS there is a **.exe** file which will install Virtualbox
* For OS X hosts there is a **.dmg** file with will install Virtualbox
* For Linux, go to this [url](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads)
and download the appropriate **.deb** or **.rpm** according to what Linux distribution you have.
