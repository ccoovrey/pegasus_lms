# Introduction to Linux Bash

In this module, Pegasus is going to learn about using a command line interface
(CLI) known as Bash (unix shell) for Linux.

GNU Bash or simply Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project as a free software replacement for the Bourne shell. First released in 1989, it has been used widely as the default login shell for most Linux distributions and Apple's macOS Mojave and earlier versions. 

Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration. The keywords, syntax, dynamically scoped variables and other basic features of the language are all copied from sh. Other features, e.g., history, are copied from csh and ksh. Bash is a POSIX-compliant shell, but with a number of extensions. 

We are going to use SANS Cyber Aces online tutorials coupled with vagrant having an ubuntu 16 OS 
(directory ubu16_vagrant in this module). 

## What's next?
In this module we are going to explore the following themes:

* Introduction to the Linux Operating System
* Bash Scripting
