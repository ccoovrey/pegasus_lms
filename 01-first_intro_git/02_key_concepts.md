## Key Concepts

**Branch**

A branch is an independent series of commits off to one side that you can use to try out an experiment or create a new feature.

**Master Branch**

Whenever you have a Git project, there is a default branch created called **Master**. This is the branch that your work should end up on eventually, once it’s ready to push to production.

**Clone**

Often you’ll want to download a copy of a project from GitHub so you can work on it locally.
